# bashfun

This is a repository for fun bash scripts that do quirky and not necessarily Holberton related stuff.

## Phases :moon:
[Phases](https://github.com/ihavemadefire/bashfun/blob/master/phases) - This bash script accepts an input of a date in format "MM/DD/YYYY". If no date is provided, it will default to today's date.
It returns the phase of the moon for either the date provided or today.
